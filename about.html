			<h3 class="center">History and Background</h3>
			<p>Apax Software was founded in 2005 by Brian Raney, Justin Raney, and Matt Smith.  Each were recent graduates of the University of Kentucky and had a passion for writing code and creating custom technology solutions.  Some of the initial clients included contacts from UK and small businesses in the surrounding area.</p>
			<p>In 2006, Apax received its first large contract.  The project involved developing a .Net web based procurement system for L3 Communications (a military contractor).  The overall idea was to create a system that allowed military personnel to be able to order new equipment while in deployment.  This project helped Apax rapidly expand in size, experience, and expertise throughout it's duration.  With over 20 people working on this project, Apax learned how to expand our team quickly and manage large projects with many stakeholders.</p>
			<p>Shortly after the launch of the original iPhone (2007), Apax noticed the trend towards mobile devices.  Apax became the first company in the area to add mobile development to our service offering, and we have more experience in mobile development than anyone else in the region.  For several years, Apax partnered with Awesome Inc to offer a regional conference called MobileX.  The conference was organized in Lexington, Nashville, Chicago, Columbus, and Cincinnati and occurred at least annually from 2009 - 2012.</p>
			<p>Over the last several years, Apax has become the anchor tenant of the Awesome Inc community.  Our experience helps provide stability and legitimacy to the community (weâ€™ve been serving clients for 10+ years), and we lean on Awesome Inc to help recruit new developers and to extend our overall reach as a company.</p>
			<p>Our three year plan is to continue to provide the best coding service available to our clients.  We enjoy working on individual projects, but we are also looking to establish a long-term partnership with a few select organizations in the area.  We are a relationship driven company and enjoy working with the same client for a longer period of time.</p>
