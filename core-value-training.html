			<h2> Why We Use the Game </h2>
			<p> This game is designed to introduce you to the Core Values that Awesome Inc stands for.
				You should already know them by now: be good, be excellent, be a friend, and be you.
				Team Alpha members and employees are trained on these four values and encouraged to
				not only practice them at Awesome Inc, but to adopt them in their own lives.
			</p>
			<h2> What You'll Be Doing </h2>
			<p> You will be tasked with building a house. To gather the materials for your house, you 
				will have to complete a series of challenges. These tasks include a memory game, a matching 
				game, a snake game, and a minesweeping game. Each task represents a core value, and you
				must complete the challenges consecutively. As you build your house, you will learn more
				about the core values and what it takes to be Awesome!
